    %h1 Connect everything 2 - puzzle game
    %h3 Rules
    The <strong>rules</strong> of <em>connect everything</em> are simple: click on the pieces to rotate them in such a way that
    %ul
      %li
        every piece becomes <strong>connected</strong> to every other one, and
      %li
        there are no cables left unconnected (unconnected cables have white endpoints)
    The game is <strong>lost</strong> if you make a <strong>wrong move</strong>.

    To solve the game it might be useful to know that
    %ul
      %li there is only <strong>one</strong> correct solution to every game, and
      %li the solution has no cycles/loops
    Try to <strong>think logically</strong>! By logical reasoning it should be possible to find pieces that can only be oriented one way.

    You will be <strong>scored</strong> on the amount of <strong>time</strong> it takes to complete the puzzle.  High scores are viewable after each game (by default you will see the scores for the level you just played as well as the best times per level, but you can see the overall high scores by clicking the link in the footer from any page).

      %li <strong>move focus</strong>: Use either the <strong>arrow keys</strong> or <strong>wasd</strong> to move focus.
      %li <strong>rotate</strong>: Use <strong>j</strong> (counterclockwise) and <strong>k</strong> (clockwise) to rotate pieces.
      %li <strong>reset</strong>: If you started to turn a piece but decide that you aren't sure where the final placement should be, hit <strong>esc</strong> to reset it while it still has focus.  If you leave it in the wrong position without doing this, you'll lose!
